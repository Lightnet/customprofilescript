  Information: This is just a prototype build. To learn the basic of the atom package api.
  Custom Profile Script is a buddy helper that do some random actions on the screen. It will display 2D/3D model character on the atom window area limited by border window.

The package will be open source. Since I am trying to get some basic idea how the API works.
